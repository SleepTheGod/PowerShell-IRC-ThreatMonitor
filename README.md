# PowerShell-IRC-ThreatMonitor
This PowerShell script is designed for real-time monitoring and analysis of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) conversations to detect potential security threats. Using basic keyword matching and simple sentiment analysis techniques, it actively scans messages within a specified IRC channel. Upon identifying messages containing predefined threatening keywords, the script triggers alerts to notify designated security teams or administrators, allowing for immediate attention to potential security risks. This monitoring tool aims to provide a preliminary level of threat detection and alerting within IRC communication channels. Note that this script employs fundamental analysis methods and does not encompass advanced AI-driven threat detection capabilities.
